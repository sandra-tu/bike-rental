# Software Engineering Project: Bike Rental System
This is a software engineering project where a bike rental system is designed and then implemented with Java. The system will keep track of bikes, customers, and bike providers for a bike rental scheme. Customers will be able to rent and return bikes, and bike providers can form partnerships for bike returns.

## Requirements and Design
We started by creating a requirements document, identifying our stakeholders, key use cases, and system states. We then designed the system using various diagrams, including UML and sequence diagrams. Both the requirements and design documents are in the documents folder (the green highlights were for marking purposes).

## Implementation
The system was implemented using Java, the classes are in the src folder. We also wrote JUnit tests, which are in the tests folder.

## Takeaway and Results
We both genuinely enjoyed the course very much and learned more about collaborative coding, as well as the process of software design. We feel our teamwork skills have vastly improved after this project. We also learned more about Java concepts such as Interfaces, which we weren't familiar with before.

We were very happy that we received a grade of 97.6% for this project!
