# Software Engineering Project: Bike Rental System
This is a software engineering project where a bike rental system is designed and then implemented with Java. The system is designed to keep track of bikes, customers, and bike providers for a bike rental scheme. Customers will be able to rent and return bikes, and bike providers can form partnerships for bike returns. More details are in the documents folder.

## Requirements and Design
We started by creating a requirements document, identifying our stakeholders and key use cases.
